### What is react?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

Walkthrough this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/) to get started. If you prefer a video course watch [these videos](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) these videos from egghead.io.

To practice you can use online code editors such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/srebalaji/pen/MVbWdB) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/me4z1xyp/2/). Alternatively you can develop locally using [CreateReactApp](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
